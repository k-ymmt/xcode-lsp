# Wrap Up

End-of-session cleanup that ensures deferred items are tracked and remaining changes are committed.

## Workflow

```dot
digraph wrap_up {
    "Session ending" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Review session work" [shape=box];
    "Deferred items?" [shape=diamond];
    "Report & update TODO.md" [shape=box];
    "Run git status" [shape=box];
    "Uncommitted changes?" [shape=diamond];
    "Report & commit\nin logical groups" [shape=box];
    "Done" [shape=doublecircle];

    "Session ending" -> "Review session work";
    "Review session work" -> "Deferred items?";
    "Deferred items?" -> "Report & update TODO.md" [label="yes"];
    "Deferred items?" -> "Run git status" [label="no"];
    "Report & update TODO.md" -> "Run git status";
    "Run git status" -> "Uncommitted changes?";
    "Uncommitted changes?" -> "Report & commit\nin logical groups" [label="yes"];
    "Uncommitted changes?" -> "Done" [label="no"];
    "Report & commit\nin logical groups" -> "Done";
}
```

## Phase 1: Update TODO

### Step 1: Identify Deferred Items

Review the current session's work and identify **all** items, regardless of severity:
- Items explicitly deferred ("let's do this later", "out of scope for now")
- Issues discovered but not addressed (bugs found, improvements noticed)
- Partially completed work that needs follow-up
- Minor suggestions from code reviews (style, naming, small refactors)
- Any "nice to have" improvements noticed during implementation

**Do not filter by severity.** Even minor items should be added to TODO.md so they are tracked and not forgotten.

### Step 2: Report to User

Present the deferred items list to the user **before** modifying TODO.md. Include:
- What was deferred and why
- Any context needed for future sessions

### Step 3: Update TODO.md

- **Add** new deferred/discovered items under appropriate sections
- **Delete** tasks completed during this session or checked tasks


**Do not Check**

```markdown
- [ ] Task
- [x] Done
```

**Delete Line**

```markdown
- [ ] Task
```

- Preserve existing structure, formatting, and language of TODO.md

**Red flag:** Do not silently add or remove items. Always report changes to the user.

## Phase 2: Commit

### Step 1: Check Status

Run `git status` to see all uncommitted changes (staged and unstaged).

### Step 2: Categorize and Report

If uncommitted changes exist, report them to the user categorized as:
- **Should commit**: Implementation code, tests, documentation, config changes
- **Should not commit**: Temporary files, debug artifacts, unfinished experiments

Then proceed to commit the "should commit" items without waiting for confirmation.

### Step 3: Commit with Appropriate Granularity

- Group related changes into logical commits (do not lump everything into one commit)
- Use descriptive commit messages following the project's conventions
- Include the original task context in commit messages (if project CLAUDE.md requires it)
- Stage specific files by name rather than `git add -A`

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| One giant commit for all changes | Split into logical, reviewable units |
| Forgetting to remove completed TODOs | Cross-reference session work against TODO.md |
| Vague TODO items like "fix later" | Be specific: include context, rationale, code locations |
| Committing debug/temp files | Review `git status` output and categorize before staging |
| Modifying TODO.md without reporting | Always present changes to user first |
